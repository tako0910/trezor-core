# BIP-44 derivation paths

Each coin uses [BIP-44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) derivation path scheme. If the coin is UTXO-based the path should have all five parts, precisely as defined in [BIP-32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki). If it is account-based we follow Stellar's [SEP-0005](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0005.md) - paths have only three parts `44'/c'/a'`. Unfortunately, lot of exceptions occur due to compatibility reasons.

Paths that do not conform to this table are allowed, but user needs to confirm a warning on Trezor. For getPublicKey we do not check if the path is followed by other non-hardened items (anyone can derive those anyway). This is beneficial  for Ethereum and its MEW compatibility, which sends `44'/60'/0'/0` for getPublicKey.

## Notes

1. <a name="Ethereum"></a> We believe this should be `44'/60'/a'`, because Ethereum is account-based, rather than UTXO-based. Unfortunately, lot of Ethereum tools (MEW, Metamask) do not use such scheme and set `a = 0` and then iterate the address index `i`. Therefore for compatibility reasons we use the same scheme: `44'/60'/0'/0/i` and only the `i` is being iterated.

2. <a name="Ripple"></a> Similar to Ethereum this should be `44'/144'/a'`. But for compatibility with other HW vendors we use `44'/144'/a'/0/0`.

3. <a name="Cardano"></a> Which allows non-hardened derivation on ed25519.

4. <a name="NEM"></a> NEM's path should be `44'/60'/a'` as per SEP-0005, but we allow `44'/60'/a'/0'/0'` as well for compatibility reasons with NanoWallet.

5. <a name="Monero"></a> Actually it is GetWatchKey for Monero.

6. <a name="BitcoinDiagram"></a> It is a bit more complicated for Bitcoin-like coins. The following diagram shows how path should be validated for Bitcoin-like coins:
